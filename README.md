### Welcome to my personal GitHub repository.

I'm (Seyed Ali Ahmadi) a PhD student in Remote Sensing at K.N.Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran (:iran:).

- :computer: Iâ€™m currently working on my PhD thesis which is about using artificial intelligence and very high resolution satellite images to assess the damage of buildings after natural disasters. Moreover, I'm working on some side projects such as, Earth Observation Satellites Calibration, and Urban Subcidence Monitoring with InSAR.
- :books: ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to optimize deep learning algorithms for remote sensing applications such as super resolution, classification, semantic segmentation, object detection and satellite image debluring.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can always contact me through my email :email: :postbox: cpt.ahmadisnipiol@yahoo.com
- :blue_heart: My interests are remote sensing :earth_americas:, machine learning :game_die:, and data science :chart_with_upwards_trend: :bar_chart:
